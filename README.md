# LordDNS
LordDNS is a proof-of-concept DNS server that really shouldn't be used in production. No seriously, this thing probably has so many vulnerabilities lmao.
In all seriousness, I made this project because I wanted to learn how DNS worked, and what better way to learn how something works then to make it myself!
I began this project with the Codecrafters tutorial. These tutorials are great because they don't actually give you the code and require you to figure it out for yourself.
If you, for some reason, want to run this DNS server on your own system, please follow the steps below. The steps apply to any operating system.

## Installation
1. Download and install node and npm if you don't already have them installed. I don't have time to explain that here, so check out [this page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for instructions.
2. Run ``npm install``
3. Run ``npm run dev`` or ``npm run start``. Either work because they literally do the same thing.
4. Profit

## Getting your own domain
If you want to get your own domain on LordDNS, dm me on Slack. I'll set up a small website for it at some point. Just be aware this dosn't come with hosting, you gotta figure that out yourself.
